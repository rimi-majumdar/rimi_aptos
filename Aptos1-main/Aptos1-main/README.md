A dApp (decentralized application) for a to-do list is a blockchain-based application that allows users to manage their tasks securely and transparently without relying on a central authority. Built on a blockchain like Ethereum or Aptos, the to-do list dApp stores tasks as data on the blockchain, ensuring they are tamper-proof and accessible only by the user. Key features may include task creation, editing, prioritization, and deadline management. Since it's decentralized, users have full control over their data, which is stored securely on the blockchain, and can interact with the dApp through a simple, user-friendly interface. Additionally, the dApp might support collaboration features, enabling multiple users to share and manage tasks in a decentralized environment.
